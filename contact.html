  <h1>Contact the croissant</h1>

  <p>You've always wanted to be able to give feedback to a real croissant? How much you love it? Or hate it? That you like its flakiness? Or that you'd prefer it to be a little less dry?
    <br><br>
    Look no further! Send an email to:
    <a href="mailto:feedback@TheCroissant.world">feedback@TheCroissant.world</a>
  <br>
  (Please be aware that it likely won't reply, though. It's a croissant after all.)
